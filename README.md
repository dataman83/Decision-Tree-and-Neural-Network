#CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Neural Networks
Overview:
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a two-layer neural network. The project encompasses data preprocessing, neural network design, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

Dataset:
CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes, split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Includes normalization of image data and one-hot encoding of labels.
Neural Network: A two-layer architecture with sigmoid and softmax activation functions.
Training: Uses backpropagation with mini-batch updates.
Evaluation: Performance metrics include training and testing accuracy.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Emphasis on optimizing learning rate and batch size.
Usage:
Clone the repository.
Ensure required libraries (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib) are installed.
Run the main program to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Results:
The model demonstrates progressive improvement in accuracy over several training epochs. Visualizations of the results are provided to analyze the impact of different hyperparameters on performance.
